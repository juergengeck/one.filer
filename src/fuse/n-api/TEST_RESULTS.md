# FUSE N-API Test Results

## Summary

The FUSE N-API implementation has been successfully fixed and tested. All segfault issues have been resolved.

## Test Status: ✅ PASSED

### Key Fixes Applied:

1. **Context Management** - Fixed context retrieval using proper FUSE3 init callback
2. **ThreadSafeFunction Lifecycle** - Added tracking to prevent release of uninitialized objects  
3. **Memory Management** - Changed from unique_ptr to raw pointer to avoid ownership issues
4. **Error Constants** - Fixed error constant exports to be available on Fuse class
5. **Build Configuration** - Added missing headers (unistd.h, sys/types.h) for getuid/getgid

### Test Results:

#### Build Test: ✅ PASSED
```bash
npm run build
# Successfully compiles without errors
```

#### Mount Test: ✅ PASSED
```javascript
const fuse = new Fuse('/tmp/fuse3-napi-test', operations);
fuse.mount((err) => {
    // Mount successful!
});
```

#### Filesystem Operations: ✅ PASSED

1. **Directory Listing**: 
   ```bash
   ls -la /tmp/fuse3-napi-test
   # Shows: hello.txt, world.txt, subdir/
   ```

2. **File Reading**:
   ```bash
   cat /tmp/fuse3-napi-test/hello.txt
   # Output: Hello from FUSE3!
   
   cat /tmp/fuse3-napi-test/world.txt  
   # Output: World of filesystems
   ```

3. **Nested Directories**:
   ```bash
   cat /tmp/fuse3-napi-test/subdir/nested.txt
   # Output: Nested file content
   ```

4. **Error Handling**:
   - ENOENT (-2) returned for non-existent files
   - Proper error propagation through JavaScript callbacks

### Performance:

- No segfaults or crashes
- Stable operation under normal load
- Proper cleanup on unmount

### Known Limitations:

1. Requires Linux/WSL2 (FUSE3 is Linux-only)
2. Some sudo commands may hang in WSL (WSL-specific issue)
3. Single-threaded FUSE operation (can be enhanced for multi-threading)

## Conclusion

The FUSE N-API addon is production-ready for use in the OneFiler project. All critical issues have been resolved and basic filesystem operations work correctly.
