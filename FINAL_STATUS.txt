ONE FILER STATUS
================

✅ FIXED:
- All ES module imports are corrected
- ONE Filer core application starts successfully
- Database initialization works
- Can run as a service without FUSE

❌ BROKEN:
- FUSE native module causes segmentation faults
- Cannot mount filesystem to Windows
- lib/fuse/n-api/build/Release/fuse3_napi.node is incompatible

WORKING COMMAND:
RUN_WITHOUT_FUSE.bat - Runs ONE Filer without filesystem mounting

NEXT STEPS:
1. Fix or replace the FUSE native module
2. Or use ONE Filer without FUSE mounting for now
