# ProjFS Directory Enumeration Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing PrjMarkDirectoryAsPlaceholder Call
**Problem**: Directory wasn't being marked as a ProjFS placeholder before virtualization
**Fix**: Added `PrjMarkDirectoryAsPlaceholder` call before `PrjStartVirtualizing`
**File**: `projfs_complete.cpp` line 387-411

### 2. ✅ Incorrect Cleanup Code
**Problem**: Pre-cleanup code tried to call `PrjStopVirtualizing` with a path instead of context
**Fix**: Removed incorrect cleanup code, documented that cleanup is handled by separate script
**File**: `projfs_complete.cpp` line 383-385

### 3. ✅ Missing Error Handling
**Problem**: No error handling in directory enumeration callback
**Fix**: Added try-catch blocks and proper error reporting
**File**: `projfs_complete.cpp` line 166-220

### 4. ✅ Added Debug Logging
**Problem**: Couldn't trace where entries were getting lost
**Fix**: Added detailed logging for:
- When JavaScript returns entries
- When each entry is being added to buffer
- Success/failure of PrjFillDirEntryBuffer calls
**File**: `projfs_complete.cpp` line 179, 196-204

## Current Status

### ✅ Working:
- ProjFS starts successfully
- Directory is properly marked as placeholder
- JavaScript callbacks are invoked
- JavaScript returns correct entries (5 directories)
- Native callbacks receive the entries

### ❓ To Be Verified (after rebuild):
- Whether entries are being added to Windows buffer correctly
- Whether PrjFillDirEntryBuffer is succeeding or failing
- Whether the issue is in the native-to-Windows interface

## Next Steps

1. **Rebuild native module** with all fixes and debug logging
2. **Run test** to see detailed output about buffer operations
3. **Verify** entries appear in File Explorer

## Technical Notes

- Windows SDK uses old `PrjFillDirEntryBuffer` signature: `(fileName, fileInfo, bufferHandle)`
- NOT the newer `PrjFillDirEntryBuffer2` signature
- Directory enumeration is synchronous in the native layer
- Adapter hardcodes root entries for consistent testing

## File Lock Prevention

For production deployments:
1. Use provided cleanup script before starting
2. Implement graceful shutdown handlers
3. Monitor for 0x800700b7 errors
4. See PROJFS_CLEANUP.md for detailed instructions
