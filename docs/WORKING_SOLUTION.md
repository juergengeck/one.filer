# ONE Filer - Working Solution

## Current Status

1. **ONE Filer Core**: ✅ Working
   - The application starts successfully
   - Database initialization works
   - All imports are fixed

2. **FUSE Module**: ❌ Broken
   - The native FUSE3 module causes segmentation faults
   - This prevents filesystem mounting
   - Needs to be rebuilt or replaced

## Working Configuration

Run ONE Filer WITHOUT FUSE mounting using:

```batch
RUN_WITHOUT_FUSE.bat
```

This starts ONE Filer as a service that can:
- Store and manage data
- Handle connections
- Run the core functionality

## To Fix FUSE Mounting

The FUSE native module needs to be properly rebuilt:

1. **Option 1**: Rebuild from source
   ```bash
   cd lib/fuse/n-api
   rm -rf build node_modules
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Option 2**: Use pre-built binaries
   - Check if there are pre-built binaries for your WSL2 environment
   - The current build seems incompatible

3. **Option 3**: Use a different FUSE library
   - Consider using a pure JavaScript FUSE implementation
   - Or switch to a different filesystem abstraction

## Alternative Access Methods

Without FUSE, you can still access ONE Filer data through:
1. HTTP API (if enabled)
2. Direct file access in the data directory
3. Command-line tools

## Summary

ONE Filer itself is working correctly. Only the FUSE filesystem mounting is broken due to a native module issue. The application can run without FUSE for testing and development purposes.
